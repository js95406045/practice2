              <p>I'm single, yet to be married. No children just yet. But I have a swwet baby nephew, Nora.</p>
              <p>I love the outdoors, like hiking, climbing, riding bicycles, running and so on. I also enjoy playing piano and listen to music in my leisure time.</p>
              <p>I work in office almost every weekdays. I'm currently pursuing a degree in software programming which I have most interest in and want to move my career forward. </p>
              <p>Thus, I make use of my spare time to study ,do assignments and work with teams.</p>
              <p>I never regret joining the BYU-Idaho, and love instructors ,peers, my peer mentors,and missionaries here, who always inspires and encourages me a lot. </p> -->
